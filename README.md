DALI Developer Application API Challenge!
By Mia Harlin, January 2025.

For my application, I created a platform to allow Users to share songs with their community anonomously. In the part I was able to implement, the User can click the login button and will be redirected to the Spotify Authentication page., which will then authenticate and get a token. After logging in and accepting Terms&Conditions you will be redirected back to the app at http://localhost:3000/. A hash is passed to the URL which contains the access token which we need to authorize the API calls. Using axios, the user can input information into the search bar and perform a GET request to the spotify API endpoint. Then the data is fetched and stored in artists. I created component files to help format and render this data. The User can then select an artist, create a comment, and post it!

With more time, this Users would be able to select a song, not an artist. They would be able to keep track of their previous posts, upvote and downvote other people's posts, and favorite posts for future reference. Posts could also have categories, like "New Discovery" and "Throwback" to help organize the song posts. They could also have categories describing what weather this song is good to listen to, in your opinion. With this feature, Users could also filter song posts based on today's current weather. For example, on a rainy day they could see what songs other Users have posted and categorized under rainy weather.

This project implements the Spotify API, and with more time would also implement the Weather API.

I large portion of this project follows this tutorial : https://dev.to/dom_the_dev/how-to-use-the-spotify-api-in-your-react-js-app-50pn.
I also followed this react tutorial to develop my skills!: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

To set up:
This app should run locally on: http://localhost:3000/
I am not exactly sure how to setup a project downloaded from Github onto a different computer. I had to create an app through https://developer.spotify.com/ and get a client ID for the app to direct to the Spotify Authentication page. Ensure that the LTS version of react is installed, along with yarn. With yarn I did "yarn add axio" which will handle our HTTP request. Also "yarn add react-router-dom."

**Learning Journey**:
The amazing thing about learning more about coding is realizing how much goes into each feature we see on a screen. It is easy to overlook the feat that is software development. Although my project does not reflect exactly what I set out do, a lot went behind creating this scaffolding of a website. Once the application challenges came out, I knew I had a lot to learn before I could even get started coding. I spent winterim trying to learn how to use React and APIs. I watched all of these tutorials and tried coding along. 

The Spotify API was suggested in the DALI API Challenge description, and I thought it sounded like a fun challenge. I could learn about login and authentification with GET and PULL requests. I've watched how music helps connection people throughout my first term at Dartmouth. I've made a lot of friends on my floor by walking by, hearing a good song, and stopping inside to ask what it's called! It's fun to see how different people's taste can be, but also how similar they can be. With this idea, I was also inspiring by how a lot of my own playlists are organized by the weather. I have a rainy day playlist, a sunny winter morning playlist, and a summer beach day playlist –of course. Weather and music are quite compatable, so I think it would be cool to implement these two APIs as well.

In terms of the app functionality, I was largely inspired by Fizz. Although I think this can be a problematic platform at times, it is also a way Dartmouth students can connect and communicate. Having a platform like this, but only for music sharing, could be a great way to feel more connected with your community, as well as discover new songs!

I'm proud of the simple project I've created because of how much I had to learn to make it! I learned about installing react and using my terminal to install more packages and helpers. I learned about APIs and the communication behind accessing data from them. If you look at this project's branches, there is a branch called failed-pages-branch. I was unable to implement multipe pages, but I spent a while trying to and definetly learned a lot in the process. The difficulty in this case was how the Spotify Authentication page would redirect back to the app, but not the correct  page route. I think if I had more time, I would want to better understanding how routing works, but this is my first time gaining exposure to different pages in a full stack web application.

I knew learning the basics of how to use react would be challenging. However, it helps simplify the process of building more complicated interactive user interfaces, and I know DALI uses it a lot as well! I learned a little about how to organize code in a full stack website. I created a components folder to put component files inside of, rather than having them all on my App.js file. A big challenge with using React was having to also learn Javascript! I had only had experience with Python, but I think it's exciting to learn new programming languages and see how they compare.

The biggest challenge was doing all of this alone. When I had a bug, I didn’t have anyone to help me look over it. The videos also used libraries and software that is always being updated, so it was also challenging to navigate that. But this challenge just helped me understand why so much of full stack development happens in a team! That's why I'm so interested in applying to DALI. I was able to learn a lot through this application process, and I know how much more I could learn inside of DALI.
